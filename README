TODO List:
Required:
Change inheritance layout to Pipes 1,2 and 3 inheriting from LongPipe then 4 and 5 inheriting from pipe 3
Store created pipes somehow. List in main class?
Also search code for "TODO" in comments
Pass the newly created pipe too getPipeData not a hard coded example

Extension(May get us extra marks)
Make FormValidatorMethods use regex not try catch

Bugs:
New pipe created without checking Quantity. Default quantity textbox contents allows for a new pipe to be created
