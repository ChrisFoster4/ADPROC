TODO List:
Required:
Removed duplicate 3 in grade drop down box
Pipes 4 and 5 dont exist
Change inheritance layout to Pipes 1,2 and 3 inheriting from LongPipe then 4 and 5 inheriting from pipe 3
Store created pipes somehow. List in main class?
Also search code for "TODO" in comments
Pass the newly created pipe too getPipeData not a hard coded example
Clear form upon submit pressed

Extension(May get us extra marks)
Make FormValidatorMethods use regex not try catch
Make pipes that are identical merge into one whilst adding their quantity

Bugs:
New pipe created without checking Quantity. Default quantity textbox contents allows for a new pipe to be created
