TODO List:
Required:
Round to two decimal places isn't working on very large values. To test add many pipes to the basket and see if the total stays at 2 decimal places

Delete pipe button. Remember to remove it from price

The total is currently rounded to two decimal places. This could result in the incorrect value after multiple pipes are added

Deny negative inputs in all three text fields. These are currently allowed

Clear text field and reset drop down boxes upon successfully creating a pipe

Also search code for "TODO" in comments

Rearrange hierarchy - 1,2 and 3 inherit from LongPipe and 4 and 5 inherit from 3


Extension(May get us extra marks)
Make FormValidatorMethods use regex not try catch
Make pipes that are identical merge into one whilst adding their quantity
