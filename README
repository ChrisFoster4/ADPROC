Repo for ADPROC Coursework


TODO List:
Required:
Make all pipes create pipes to put in basket not just type 1

Rearrange hierarchy - 1,2 and 3 inherit from LongPipe and 4 and 5 inherit from 3


Also search code for "TODO" in comments

Potential issues:
The total is currently rounded to two decimal places. This could result in the incorrect value after multiple pipes are added

Is the current method of rounding numbers allowed? 


Extension(May get us extra marks)
Are you sure on delete pipe and empty basket buttons
Make FormValidatorMethods use regex not try catch
Make pipes that are identical merge into one whilst adding their quantity
